Have you seen capabilites of [MIT mini cheetah](https://youtu.be/xNeZWP5Mx9s?si=x8OoohQQlFV-ZDrr). What do you think, how important was the actuator design for this? What if I told you that these technologies are nothing fancy, and are being used all over the place? Ok ok, it **does** require some work, and experiance ;- *to do things right*, but what doesn't? So, not scared away yet? Check their actuator paper[[1]](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.18/motion/papers/mit-cheetah-actuator.pdf). Or the [Thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/118671) from the Ben Ketz(yeap, one student who built this actuator!)


You know, at some point just working with regular PCBs gets boring?! How to make it interesting you ask? Ha, make it juuuucy :D Ok, basically powerful. You know, its physics baby. Devels advocate they say, how else to justify [this torture - get all the juice out of it!!](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com/2018/07/fixed-noise-and-thermal-testing.html).


**What you will gain:**

- Hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of Brushless Motors, and their
control
- Best practices for PCB Design and Project Collaboration
- Experience building, prototyping
- Hacking electronic signals (via oscilloscope, etc.)
- Maybe ocasional chat with us ;-

**Requirements from candidates:**

- Knowledge of **Electronics/Power** electronics
- Experience with **PCB design** and soldering
- Knowledge of one of the popular PCB Design software
- Basic **Matlab** skills
- Proficiency in English C1, reading academic papers
- Plus are:
    - Understanding how **Motors** work
    - Familiarity with **GIT**
    - **Embedded system** programming, knowledge of C language
    - Working skills in **Ubuntu** operating system

To apply, you can send your CV, and short motivation to:
