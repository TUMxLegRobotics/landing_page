Picture not respresenting your understanding of Embedded Dev properly? Lets talk ''/
{{< /imgproc >}}

Sooo, you want to know all those nitty-gritty details how processor works, what is all that fuss around 0s and 1s in computer logic. Ohh, you want to work with signals, communication protocols, transistors, uuuuu. Oh damn, you rock! 

Maybe also you want to have all-mighty robot control via some everyday code magic??? Hm, ok, lets see what we have here. Okk, big inhale, trying to be serious for a moment... You will need to master the mighty skill of C programming, prepare to argue over the "clean code" and *what makes code reusable* day and night. Like that wasn't enough, you need to understand how those BLDCs work, what others have messed up in Electronics and Mechanics and make it run somehow. Good luck :) Ahhh, alright, we managed that before, don't worry now, you will need to worry later HA HA HA. 

*As a side effect, you might start researching, reading fancy papers [2] that you can try to implement in code. You can imagine that our robot capabilities will be dependent on you, so be serious damn it.*

**What you will gain:**

- Hands-on experience and in-depth understanding Microcontrollers, register level programming, varios communication protocols
- Understanding Motor Control and various aspects of BLDC motors
- Best practices for Embedded software development
- Hacking electronic signals (via oscilloscope, etc.)
- Maybe ocasional chat with us ;-

**Requirements from candidates:**

- Good knowledge of **C** or(and) other programming language
- Understandings of **Microcontroller programming**
- Working with **DataSheets and Documentations** of various Devices
- Basics in Electronics and Mechanics
- Proficiency in English C1, reading academic papers
- Plus are:
    - **Arduino** programming
    - Familiarity with **GIT**

To apply, you can send your CV, and short motivation to:
