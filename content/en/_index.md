We are at the **founding stage**. Trying to assemble a student team and build up hardware to provide an platform for research and collaboration (competitions?).

Being supported by [Chair of Robotics and System Inteligence](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/rsi/home/), there is an opportunity to 
register contributions as the *Internship, or Forschungspraxis/Semesterarbeit*. Meaning one can receive TUM credits for the work.

You will be supported and guided by the PhD candidates who wish this project to evolve.

If you are looking for joining our efforts and gaining hands-on experiance building things, you are more then welcome to [apply](/docs/).

***Note:** We have strict selection procedure, please check that you fit requirements before applying.*
