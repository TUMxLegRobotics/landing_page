## Can we answer some of your questions?
Hey! Have you ever wanted to be part of the community, build something together! 

Yes??... Then you might want to make it somehow useful for your studies as well!? Oh yess? 

There is a hope for you, you might have found right place. 

We have been organized by researchers whose daily work is to build new things and try things out. Doing it alone is not fun and also not productive. Thats
why we thought of organising this community. 

Check out our [open positions](/docs/).
